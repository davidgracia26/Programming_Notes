Notes for the book The Speed of Trust by Stephen Covey

# The Speed of Trust

> ## Nothing is as fast as the speed of trust.

Trust changes everything.

If trust goes down, then speed will go down and cost will go up.

If trust goes up, then speed will go up and cost will go down.

Trust has a tax and dividend.

Strategy times Execution times Trust equals Results.

```(S*E)T = R```

- 80% Tax (Nonexistent Trust)
- 60% Tax (Very Low Trust)
- 40% Tax (Low Trust)
- 20% Tax (Trust Issues)
- 0% Tax (Trust is not an issue)
- 20% Dividend (Trust is a visible asset)
- 40% Dividend (World Class Trust)

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
|Trust is soft.|Trust is hard, real, and quantifiable. It measurably affects both speed and cost.
|Trust is slow.|Nothing is as fast as the speed of trust.|
|Trust is built solely on integrity.|Trust is a function of both character (which includes integrity) and competence.|
|You either have trust or you don't.|Trust can be both created and destroyed.|
|Once lost, trust cannot be restored.|Though difficult, in most cases lost trust can be restored.|
|You can't teach trust.|Trust can be effectively taught and learned, and it can become a leverageable, strategic advantage.|
|Trusting people is too risky.|Not trusting people is a greater risk.|
|Trust can only be built face-to-face.|Trust can be built on virtual teams and digital environments.|
|Trust is established one person at a time.|Establishing trust with the one establishes trust with the many.|

> ## Relationship Trust - *The Principle of Behavior*
### ***The 13 Behaviors***

Building trust accounts:

1) Each trust account is unique.
2) All deposits and withdrawals are not created equal.
3) What constitutes as a "deposit" to one person may not to another.
4) Withdrawals are typically larger than deposits.
5) Sometimes the fastest way to build trust is to stop making withdrawals.
6) Recognize that each relationship has two trust accounts.

The Curve: (Too little = weakness)-(Sweet Spot = strength)-(Too much = weakness)

### 1 - ***Talk Straight***
Be honest. Tell the truth. Let people know where you stand. Use simple language. Call things what they are. Demonstrate integrity. Don't manipulate people or distort facts. Don't spin the truth. Don't leave false impressions.

### 2 - ***Demonstrate Respect***
Genuinely care for others. Show you care. Respect the dignity of every person and every role. Treat everyone with respect, especially those who can't do anything for you. Show kindness in the little things. Don't fake caring. Don't attempt to be "efficient" with people.

### 3 - ***Create Transparency***
Tell the truth in a way people can verify. Declare your intent. Get real and be genuine. Be open and authentic. Err on the side of disclosure. Be transparent about not being able to be transparent (e.g., when the law or ethics preclude it). Operate on the premise of "What you see is what you get." Don't have hidden agendas. Don't hide information.

### 4 - ***Right Wrongs***
Make things right when you're wrong. Apologize quickly. Make restitution where possible. Practice "service recoveries." Demonstrate humility. Don't cover things up. Don't let pride get in the way of doing the right thing.

### 5 - ***Show Loyalty***
Give credit to others. Speak about people as if they were present. Represent others who aren't there to speak for themselves. Don't bad-mouth others behind their backs. When you must talk about others, check your intent. Don't disclose others' private information.

### 6 - ***Deliver Results***
Establish a track record of results. Get the right things done. Make things happen. Accomplish what you're hired to do. Be on time and within budget. Don't overpromise and underdeliver. Don't make excuses for not delivering.

### 7 - ***Get Better***
Continuously improve. Increase your Capabilities. Be a constant learner. Develop feedback systems-both formal and informal. Act on the feedback you receive. Thank people for feedback. Don't consider yourself above feedback. Don't assume today's knowledge and skills will be sufficient for tomorrow's challenges.

### 8 - ***Confront Reality***
Take issues head on, even the "undiscussables." Address the tough stuff directly. Acknowledge the unsaid. Confront issues before they turn into major problems. Confront the reality, not the person. Remove the "sword from their hands." Lead out courageously in conversation. Don't skirt the real issues. Don't bury your head in the sand.

### 9 - ***Clarify Expectations***
Disclose and reveal expectations. Discuss them. Validate them. Renegotiate them if needed and possible. Don't violate expectations. Don't assume that expectations are clear or shared.

### 10 - ***Practice Accountability***
Hold yourself accountable first; hold others accountable second. Take responsibility for results, good or bad. Be clear on how you'll communicate how you're doing-and how others are doing. Don't avoid or shirk responsiblity. Don't blame others or point fingers when things go wrong.

### 11 - ***Listen First***
Listen before you speak. Understand. Diagnose. Listen with your ears-and your eyes and heart. Find out what the most important behaviors are to the people you're working with. Don't assume you know what matters most to others. Don't presume you have all the answers-or all the questions.

### 12 - ***Keep Commitments***
Say what you're going to do, then do what you say you're going to do. Make commitments-both explicit and implicit-very carefully, and keep them at almost all costs. Communicate when you can't. Make keeping commitments the symbol of your honor. Don't break confidences. Don't attempt to "spin" your way out of a commitment you've broken.

### 13 - ***Extend Trust***
Demonstrate a propensity to trust. Extend trust abundantly to those who have earned your trust. Extend trust conditionally to those who are earning your trust. Learn how to appropriately extend trust to others based on the situation, risk, and credibility (character and competence) of the people involved. But start with a propensity to trust. Don't withhold trust because there is risk involved.
